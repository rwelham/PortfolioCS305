# PortfolioCS305

This project was made for the client of Artemis Financial which wanted a secure way to encrypt data from clients who are giving their bank and financial information to receive advice on what to do and how to use investments. The main concern was how secure the software was. Most of the vulnerabilities came from a need to update things to the most recent technology and add certain checks for the program. We also produced dependency checks which was helpful for seeing what issues the program had. The dependency check was generated and checked after the code was refactored to ensure that in making the code more secure, new vulnerabilities or breaks in the code didn't occur. This project shows knowledge on including security when developing and keeping in mind that security is a vital part of software development.
